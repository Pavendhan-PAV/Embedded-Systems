# Embedded-Systems
Software simulation of embedded systems using IAR<br><br>

## Lab 1
Write a register level program to calculate each
bit address of Port F Data register, where the red,
green, blue LEDs are connected. Also light each
led with different delay 1 sec, 2sec, 3 sec.

## Lab 2
Write a program to get different colour with
combination of led lighting. This operation you
have carried out using a user switch SW1 on
PF4 pin.

## Lab 3
Activate the locked switch also from LAB 2 program. Now use both the user switches to operate the LED in different cobination. 

## Lab 4
DAC design using R-2R ladder circuit.
